The issue in my dataset is merging two different data sets and fixing nulls or errors. I did find some outliers, but I was able to fact check and fix them. I changed the missing values to '0' or 'unknown', based on the data type of the column. Luckily, there were no duplicates that came to my attention. Data types were good the way they were."
